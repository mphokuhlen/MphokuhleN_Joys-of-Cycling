    <p class="lead">
      Cycling, for me, is the perfect combination of physical challenge and mental escape. There’s an unparalleled sense of accomplishment that comes from conquering a steep climb and the pure, exhilarating reward of the descent. It strips away the distractions of daily life, replacing them with the sound of whirring gears, the rush of wind, and the rhythm of your own breath. Whether it's a brisk morning commute that kickstarts the day, a long weekend tour through scenic countryside, or navigating challenging mountain bike trails, every ride is a miniature adventure. It’s a hobby that promotes health, sustainability, and a deep connection to the environment around you. The bicycle is a simple machine, yet it grants profound freedom, allowing you to cover distances you would never see on foot and experience the landscape in a completely immersive way. It truly transforms my perspective and is my favorite way to spend time.

      <li><strong>Hydration and Nutrition:</strong> Carry enough water and fuel (like energy bars) for longer rides.</li>
      <li><strong>Basic Repair Kit:</strong> Know how to fix a flat tire — a patch kit, tire levers, and a portable pump are essential.</li>
